# LENA_contingencies
GUI for computing contingency tables from .its files.

## HOW TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE

### (1) Set up a directory of .its files for batch analysis

> Identify a directory in which to place all of the .its files intended for batch analysis. You do not have to change files' names or contents--the program will extract subject ID information from the files directly.

### (2) Run the program from the source code

> In the temporary absence of an executable form of the program for Mac and Windows, Python (v2.7) must be installed. The entry point of the program is in the file control.py. To run the program, enter the following command line instruction:

<code>>>> python /.../path/to/directory/control.py</code>
> Once the program launces, you can begin specifying the details of the anlaysis to be conducted. The video below gives a walkthrough on using the interface:
